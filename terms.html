                <h3>10.2. Amicable Resolution:</h3>
                <p>In the event of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the breach, termination, or validity thereof, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute amicably through good faith negotiations.

                <p>If the parties are unable to resolve the dispute amicably within sixty (60) days of the written notice, any unresolved dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or the Services shall be settled by binding arbitration administered by [Specify Arbitration Body, e.g., the American Arbitration Association] in accordance with its Commercial Arbitration Rules, and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator(s) may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.

                <h3>10.5. Equitable Relief:</h3>
                <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, Aquafiname reserves the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation, or violation of our copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents, or other intellectual property rights.</p>

                <h2>19. Third-Party Services and Content</h2>
                <p>The Services may integrate with or contain links to third-party websites, applications, or services (e.g., payment processors, weather data providers, smart home platforms). Aquafiname does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for the availability, accuracy, content, products, or services of such third-party services. Your use of third-party services is subject to their respective terms and conditions and privacy policies. You acknowledge sole responsibility for and assume all risk arising from your use of any third-party websites or resources.</p>
                <p>While our smart monitoring solutions may integrate with external data sources (e.g., local weather forecasts), Aquafiname does not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of such third-party data. This data is provided for informational purposes to enhance your system's efficiency but should not be the sole basis for critical decisions regarding water management or property safety.</p>

                <h2>20. System Performance and Environmental Factors</h2>
                <p>You acknowledge that the performance of Aquafiname rainwater harvesting systems and the accuracy of smart monitoring data are influenced by numerous environmental factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Rainfall Variability:</strong> Actual rainfall amounts and patterns can differ significantly from historical averages or forecasts, impacting water collection volumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Climate Conditions:</strong> Temperature extremes, humidity, and wind can affect system components and water quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Local Site Conditions:</strong> Factors such as roof material, surrounding vegetation, dust, and airborne pollutants can influence the quality and quantity of collected rainwater.</li>
                    <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Consistent and proper maintenance by the user is critical for optimal system performance and water quality.</li>
                    <li><strong>External Factors:</strong> Power outages, internet service disruptions, or issues with third-party integrations (e.g., mobile network providers) can affect the functionality of smart monitoring features.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Aquafiname strives to design and provide systems that are resilient to these factors, but we cannot guarantee specific performance metrics or water savings that are contingent on such external variables. Any projections or estimates provided are based on reasonable assumptions and historical data but are not guarantees of future performance.</p>
