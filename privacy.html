                <p><strong>Last Updated: July 5, 2025</strong></p>

                <p>Aquafiname ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, disclose, and protect the information we obtain from users of our website, products, and services, including our rainwater harvesting systems and smart monitoring solutions. By accessing or using our services, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with these terms, please do not access or use our services.</p>

                <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>We collect various types of information to provide and improve our services to you. This includes:</p>
                <h3>1.1. Personal Information You Provide to Us:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Contact Information:</strong> When you request a consultation, fill out a contact form, subscribe to our newsletter, or make an inquiry, we may collect your name, email address, phone number, and postal address. This information is essential for us to communicate with you effectively, provide accurate service quotes, and deliver our products.</li>
                    <li><strong>Account Information:</strong> If you create an account for our smart monitoring services, we collect your username, password, and other registration details. This data is necessary for managing your access to our secure platforms and personalized system dashboards.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service-Related Information:</strong> When you purchase or inquire about our systems, we may collect details about your property (e.g., roof size, type, existing infrastructure, geographical location, historical water usage data) to provide accurate proposals, tailored designs, and efficient installation services. This helps us optimize the rainwater harvesting solution for your specific needs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Payment Information:</strong> For processing transactions, we may collect billing addresses and payment card details. Please note that we typically use third-party payment processors, and we do not store sensitive financial information directly on our servers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Communications:</strong> Records of your correspondence with us, including customer support inquiries, feedback, survey responses, and any other direct communications. This helps us improve our services and address your concerns effectively.</li>
                    <li><strong>User Content:</strong> Any information you choose to upload or submit through our platforms, such as project details, photos (if applicable), or preferences related to your rainwater harvesting system.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>1.2. Information Collected Automatically:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> We automatically collect information about how you access and use our website and services. This may include your IP address, browser type and version, operating system, device type, screen resolution, referring URLs, pages viewed, time spent on pages, clickstream data, and the dates/times of your visits. This data helps us understand user behavior and improve website functionality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> Information about the device you use to access our services, such as device model, unique device identifiers (e.g., IMEI, MAC address), mobile network information, and crash data. This assists in troubleshooting and optimizing compatibility.</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Information:</strong> We may collect general location information (e.g., city, state, country) derived from your IP address. For smart monitoring services, precise location data (e.g., GPS coordinates) may be collected with your explicit consent to provide location-specific features such as localized weather data for predictive water management, and to optimize system performance based on regional rainfall patterns.</li>
                    <li><strong>Smart System Data:</strong> For users of our smart water monitoring systems, we collect detailed operational data related to system performance. This includes, but is not limited to, rainwater collection volumes, real-time tank levels, water usage patterns (e.g., for irrigation, toilet flushing), system alerts (e.g., low water, filter change reminders), pump activity, and sensor readings. This data is crucial for the core functionality of the monitoring service, enabling real-time insights, performance optimization, and proactive maintenance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cookies and Tracking Technologies:</strong> We use cookies, web beacons, pixels, and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our website and hold certain information. These technologies help us remember your preferences, analyze website traffic, personalize content, and deliver targeted advertisements. For more details on how we use these technologies and your choices, please refer to our dedicated <a href="cookies.html">Cookies Policy</a>.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>3. How We Share Your Information</h2>
                <p>We may share your information with third parties only in specific circumstances and always with appropriate safeguards. These circumstances include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> We engage trusted third-party vendors, consultants, and other service providers to perform functions on our behalf. These services include, but are not limited to, payment processing, website hosting, data storage, cloud services, analytics, marketing and advertising services, customer support, and IT infrastructure. These service providers are contractually obligated to protect your information and use it solely for the purposes for which it was disclosed, in compliance with this Privacy Policy and applicable data protection laws.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Business Transfers:</strong> In the event of a merger, acquisition, reorganization, sale of assets, or bankruptcy, your personal information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will notify you via email and/or a prominent notice on our website of any such change in ownership or control of your personal information.</li>
                    <li><strong>For Legal Reasons and Protection:</strong> We may disclose your information if required to do so by law, court order, or governmental regulation, or if we believe in good faith that such action is necessary to (a) comply with a legal obligation; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of Aquafiname; (c) prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the services; (d) protect the personal safety of users of the services or the public; or (e) protect against legal liability.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may share your information with third parties when we have obtained your explicit consent to do so. This consent will be obtained prior to sharing your data for specific purposes not covered by this policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Aggregated or Anonymized Data:</strong> We may share aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This type of data is often used for industry research, market analysis, public reports on sustainability, or to demonstrate the collective impact of our systems without revealing individual identities. For example, we might publish statistics on the total volume of rainwater saved by Aquafiname users in a particular region.</li>
                    <li><strong>With Affiliates:</strong> We may share information with our current or future affiliates, subsidiaries, or other companies under common control and ownership with Aquafiname, who will be bound by this Privacy Policy.</li>

                <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
                <p>We are deeply committed to safeguarding your personal information and employ robust security measures to protect it from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. Our security practices include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Encryption:</strong> We utilize industry-standard encryption technologies, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), to encrypt data both in transit (when data is sent between your browser and our servers) and at rest (when data is stored on our servers). This helps prevent unauthorized interception or access to your sensitive information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Access Controls:</strong> Access to your personal data is strictly limited to authorized employees, contractors, and agents who require the information to perform their job functions (e.g., customer support, technical maintenance, product development). All personnel are subject to strict confidentiality obligations.</li>
                    <li><strong>Regular Audits and Assessments:</strong> We conduct regular security audits, vulnerability assessments, and penetration testing to identify and address potential weaknesses in our systems and infrastructure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Physical Security:</strong> Our data centers and physical infrastructure are protected by robust physical security measures to prevent unauthorized access to hardware and data storage facilities.</li>
                    <li><strong>Data Minimization:</strong> We adhere to the principle of data minimization, collecting only the personal information that is strictly necessary for the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> We have an established incident response plan to promptly address and mitigate any potential data breaches or security incidents, including notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities as required by law.</li>
                    <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> All employees receive regular training on data privacy and security best practices to ensure they understand their responsibilities in protecting your information.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, it is important to acknowledge that no method of transmission over the internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. Therefore, while we are committed to protecting your data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. We encourage you to also take steps to protect your personal information, such as using strong, unique passwords and being cautious about sharing personal details online.</p>

                <h2>5. Your Data Protection Rights</h2>
                <p>Depending on your geographic location and the applicable data protection laws (such as GDPR in Europe or CCPA in California), you may have specific rights regarding your personal data. Aquafiname is committed to facilitating the exercise of these rights. These rights may include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Right to Access:</strong> The right to request confirmation as to whether or not your personal data is being processed, and, where that is the case, access to the personal data and certain information about its processing. You can request copies of your personal data held by us.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Rectification:</strong> The right to request that we correct any information you believe is inaccurate or incomplete. This includes updating outdated contact details or correcting errors in your account information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Erasure (Right to be Forgotten):</strong> The right to request that we erase your personal data under certain conditions, such as when the data is no longer necessary for the purposes for which it was collected, or if you withdraw consent and there is no other legal ground for processing.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing:</strong> The right to request that we restrict the processing of your personal data under certain conditions, for example, if you contest the accuracy of the data, or if the processing is unlawful.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Object to Processing:</strong> The right to object to our processing of your personal data, under certain conditions, particularly when the processing is based on legitimate interests or for direct marketing purposes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Data Portability:</strong> The right to request that we transfer the data that we have collected to another organization, or directly to you, in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, under certain conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Withdraw Consent:</strong> Where we rely on your consent as the legal basis for processing your personal data, you have the right to withdraw that consent at any time. Withdrawal of consent will not affect the lawfulness of processing based on consent before its withdrawal.</li>
                    <li><strong>Right to Lodge a Complaint:</strong> You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority if you believe your data protection rights have been violated.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To exercise any of these rights, please contact us using the contact details provided in Section 9 of this Privacy Policy. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable data protection laws and within the legally required timeframe. We may need to verify your identity before fulfilling your request to ensure the security of your personal data.</p>
